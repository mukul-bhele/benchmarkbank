# Banking Insights Project

## Project Description

The Banking Insights project focuses on in-depth data analysis within the banking sector. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset and incorporating web scraping using Selenium, we aim to uncover valuable insights, patterns, and trends in the banking industry. Our analysis covers various aspects, including ATM distribution, credit and debit card statistics, transaction data, and more.

## Data Sources

We obtained the dataset used for this project from [provide source or link]. This dataset contains a rich array of banking information, offering insights into different banks, ATMs, credit and debit card statistics, and transaction data.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- **`data/`**: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, visualizations, and analysis.
- **`scripts/`**: Python scripts for specific data analysis tasks.
- **`figures/`**: Directory for storing generated visualizations and graphs.

## Data Exploration

### ATM Distribution

We delve into the distribution of ATMs among banks, classifying them into On-Site, Off-Site, and Micro ATMs. Visualizations will provide insights into the ATM strategies adopted by different banks.

### Bank Comparison

This section involves comprehensive comparisons of banks based on various parameters, such as the total number of ATMs, credit and debit card deployment, and other relevant statistics. Visualizations and analysis will illustrate how these banks perform in the market.

### Transaction Type Analysis

We perform a deep analysis of transaction data, distinguishing transaction types, including PoS transactions, online transactions, and more. Visualizations will facilitate comparisons between banks concerning the number and value of these transactions.

## Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)

Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is applied to our dataset to assess the efficiency and performance of different banks. This analysis provides valuable insights into the relative efficiency of decision-making units in the banking sector.

## Web Scraping with Selenium

To enhance our dataset, we employed web scraping techniques using Selenium. This allowed us to collect real-time data and extract valuable insights from bank websites, further enriching our analysis.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Explore the Jupyter notebooks and scripts in the `notebooks/` and `scripts/` directories for data analysis and visualizations.

2. Install the required Python packages using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
